## Requirements

- An Extole account with an API token (see [Getting a Token](#getting-a-token))
- Node.js 22.12 or higher (only required for the from-source install method)

## Install

**Binary (no Node required) -- Mac and Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extole/extole-cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

Installs to `/usr/local/bin/extole` when that directory is writable. Otherwise (the common case on macOS, where `/usr/local/bin` is root-owned) it installs to `~/.local/bin/extole` and adds that directory to your shell profile's `PATH`. Open a new terminal afterward, or run the `export PATH=...` line the installer prints. Override the location with `EXTOLE_INSTALL=/your/path`.

**Binary -- Windows:**

Download `extole-windows-x64.exe` from the <Anchor target="_blank" href="https://github.com/extole/extole-cli/releases/latest">latest release</Anchor>, rename it to `extole.exe`, and place it somewhere on your `PATH`.

**Homebrew (Mac):**

```bash
brew install extole/tap/extole
```

**npm (requires Node 22.12+):**

```bash
npm install -g @extole/cli
```

**From source (requires Node 22.12+):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/extole/extole-cli.git
cd extole-cli
npm install
npm link
```

Verify: `extole --version`

## Who Is This For

This CLI targets **developers and technical operators** working with the Extole API -- engineers integrating Extole into their platform, technical support staff diagnosing reward and event issues, and solutions engineers configuring programs.

Several commands (`components deploy`, `campaigns quality-rules`, `health provision-dkim`) require elevated account permissions. Standard API tokens with `CLIENT_ADMIN` scope cover most read operations; write operations and some diagnostics require `CLIENT_SUPERUSER`. If you hit a 403, your token may lack the necessary scope.

## Quickstart

Install using any method from the [Install](#install) section above, then:

```bash
# Authenticate
extole auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Verify it works
extole whoami

# Try something useful
extole programs
extole rewards --email customer@example.com
extole chat "what campaigns are live on this account?"
```

For help on any command: `extole --help`, `extole <command> --help`

## Getting a Token

Log in to <Anchor target="_blank" href="https://my.extole.com">my.extole.com</Anchor>, navigate to **Settings → API Access**, and create or copy an API token. The token needs `CLIENT_ADMIN` scope for most read operations and `CLIENT_SUPERUSER` for write operations and advanced diagnostics.

Contact your Extole account team if you do not have access to API settings.

## Auth

```
extole auth login --token TOKEN                               # save token (account name derived from client)
extole auth login --token TOKEN --account acme --set-default  # save token, set as default
extole auth login --token TOKEN --account staging             # save additional account
extole auth default acme                                      # change default account
extole auth list                                              # show all accounts with default marker
extole auth status                                            # verify token + connectivity
extole auth token                                             # print raw token for the default account
extole auth token --account acme                              # print raw token for a named account
extole auth logout --account acme                             # remove account
```

`auth token` prints the raw token to stdout (credential warning on stderr):

```
extole auth token | pbcopy
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(extole auth token)" https://api.extole.io/v6/webhooks/built
```

All commands use the default account unless `--account NAME` is specified.

```bash
export EXTOLE_TOKEN=your-token-here  # use this token for all commands
export EXTOLE_ACCOUNT=acme           # use this account for all commands
```

## Ping / Whoami

```
extole ping                           # verify connectivity (exit 0 = OK)
extole whoami                         # verify token and show client identity, scopes, and expiry
extole whoami --account other-client  # check a non-default account
extole whoami --json
```

`whoami` calls `/v4/tokens` and returns client name, scopes, token type, and days until expiry.

## Person

```
extole person get --email jane@example.com         # profile data

extole person steps --email jane@example.com       # step history (default 25)
extole person steps --email jane@example.com --limit 100
extole person steps --email jane@example.com --listen        # tail live steps (Ctrl+C to stop)
extole person steps --email jane@example.com --duration 30   # tail and auto-exit after 30s
extole person steps --email jane@example.com --listen --json

extole person rewards --email jane@example.com              # rewards for this person
extole person rewards --email jane@example.com --status EARNED
extole person rewards --email jane@example.com --json

extole person relationships --email jane@example.com        # advocate↔friend referral relationships
extole person relationships --email jane@example.com --json

extole person stats --email jane@example.com                # personal + referral network stats
extole person stats --email jane@example.com --json

extole person report --id <person_id>                       # profile events report ALL_TIME (~30-90s)
extole person report --email jane@example.com               # looks up person ID then runs report
```

`relationships` shows each referral link -- role (ADVOCATE/FRIEND), program, other person's ID, channel, and creation date. `stats` shows two rows: the person's own AOV/LTV/conversions and the same metrics aggregated across their referral network.

## Share Links

Two directions:

```
extole share-links list --email jane@example.com              # all share links for a person
extole share-links list --email jane@example.com --label credit-cards
extole share-links list --email jane@example.com --json

extole share-links lookup chrisbackfillcw214                  # reverse: code → owner
extole share-links lookup https://demo-data-finserv.extole.io/chrisbackfillcw214
extole share-links lookup chrisbackfillcw214 --json
```

`list` returns share links (label, code, URL); use `--label` to filter across programs. `lookup` is the reverse: given a share code or full URL, returns the owning person and program.

## Rewards

```
extole rewards --email jane@example.com
extole rewards --email jane@example.com --status EARNED
extole rewards --email jane@example.com --limit 50

extole rewards get <reward_id>              # full detail including coupon code
extole rewards get <reward_id> --steps      # also show recipient step history
extole rewards get <reward_id> --json

extole rewards history <reward_id>          # state-transition timeline (EARNED → SENT → FULFILLED → ...)
extole rewards state-summary                # account-wide reward counts by state, bucketed over time
extole rewards find-coupon <code>           # reverse lookup: who got this coupon and was it used?
```

Reward states: `EARNED`, `FULFILLED`, `SENT`, `REDEEMED`, `CANCELED`, `FAILED`, `EXPIRED`

Error messages are unambiguous about whether the person exists:

- `No person found for jane@example.com` -- email not in Extole
- `No rewards found for jane@example.com (person ID: abc123)` -- person exists, genuinely zero rewards

`rewards history` is the go-to for "why is this reward stuck?" -- each row shows the state change, when it happened, and whether the transition succeeded. `rewards state-summary` gives ops-level aggregate counts plus a per-week breakdown. `rewards find-coupon` reverse-looks up a coupon code to find who got it, what state it's in, and whether Extole was told it was redeemed.

> `REDEEMED` means "someone told Extole it was used" (via a redemption event or webhook) -- not "definitely used at point of sale." Without that integration, a coupon can be used at checkout and the reward stays in `SENT` forever.

## Reward Suppliers

Inspect and manage reward suppliers (BHN, coupons, custom, Tango) -- used by reward rules in campaigns to mint the actual reward value.

```
extole reward-suppliers                              # all configured suppliers with face values
extole reward-suppliers --filter manual              # name/type substring match
extole reward-suppliers get <supplier-id>            # full detail: face_value, limits, expiry, tags
extole reward-suppliers coupons <supplier-id>        # for MANUAL_COUPON: count + sample preview
extole reward-suppliers coupons <supplier-id> --list # dump all codes (paged with --limit)

# Create a MANUAL_COUPON supplier
extole reward-suppliers create --type MANUAL_COUPON --name "Test Coupons" --face-value 25 --face-value-type USD --warn-limit 10 --dry-run
extole reward-suppliers create --type MANUAL_COUPON --name "Test Coupons" --face-value 25 --face-value-type USD --warn-limit 10

# Create a CUSTOM_REWARD supplier
extole reward-suppliers create --type CUSTOM_REWARD --name "Statement Credit" --face-value 50 --face-value-type USD --custom-reward-type ACCOUNT_CREDIT

# For TANGO_V2, PAYPAL_PAYOUTS, SALESFORCE_COUPON -- use --body for full JSON control
extole reward-suppliers create --body '{"reward_supplier_type":"TANGO_V2","name":"Gift Card","face_value_type":"USD","face_value":25,"account_id":"...","utid":"..."}'

# Upload coupon codes to a MANUAL_COUPON supplier
extole reward-suppliers upload-coupons <supplier-id> --codes CODE1,CODE2,CODE3
extole reward-suppliers upload-coupons <supplier-id> --file ./coupons.txt
extole reward-suppliers upload-coupons <supplier-id> --file ./coupons.txt --dry-run
```

The list uses the `/built` endpoint so component-bundle suppliers display their resolved values. `coupons` refuses non-MANUAL\_COUPON suppliers -- other types mint codes on demand. `create` supports typed flags for `MANUAL_COUPON` and `CUSTOM_REWARD`; use `--body <json>` for `TANGO_V2`, `PAYPAL_PAYOUTS`, and `SALESFORCE_COUPON`. `upload-coupons` accepts a flat text file (one code per line) or `--codes` for inline lists; use `--dry-run` to preview.

## Programs

```
extole programs           # list LIVE programs and campaigns
extole programs --all     # include PAUSED, STOPPED, NOT_LAUNCHED
extole programs --json
```

## Campaigns

Inspect per-campaign configuration: which quality rules are turned on, and what the MaxMind fraud-scoring controller-trigger settings are.

```
extole campaigns quality-rules <campaign-id>                       # enabled quality rules only
extole campaigns quality-rules <campaign-id> --include-disabled    # also show disabled rules
extole campaigns quality-rules <campaign-id> --json                # raw QualityRuleResponse[]

extole campaigns maxmind <campaign-id>                             # enabled MaxMind triggers only
extole campaigns maxmind <campaign-id> --include-disabled          # also show disabled triggers
extole campaigns maxmind <campaign-id> --json                      # raw trigger array

extole campaigns reward-rules <campaign-id>                        # per-role reward rules: rewardee, trigger, supplier, constraints
extole campaigns reward-rules <campaign-id> --json                 # raw RewardRuleResponse[]
```

### Quality Rules

`quality-rules` calls `GET /v2/campaigns/{id}/incentive/quality-rules` and renders the configured legacy quality rules. Each row shows the rule type, whether it is enabled, which action types it applies to (`ANY_CLICK`, `ANY_SHARE`, `ANY_REGISTER`, `ANY_PURCHASE`, `ANY_PROMOTION`), and any rule-specific properties (e.g. `cap_number=10, lookback_interval=7` on `REFERRAL_CAP`).

### MaxMind

`maxmind` walks the built campaign (`GET /v2/campaigns/{id}/built`) and surfaces every `trigger_type: MAXMIND` controller-trigger, with its step, phase, `risk_threshold`, `ip_threshold`, `allow_high_risk_email`, and `default_quality_score`. When a trigger has thresholds different from the recommended value of `20` (the legacy default was `5`), an advisory is printed to stderr. The advisory does not appear in `--json` output.

## Audiences

Inspect audiences, their size, members, and recent push/sync history. Useful when verifying that an async audience operation (SFDC sync, file import, replace, etc.) completed without round-tripping through the my.extole UI.

```
extole audiences list                                       # audiences on the account (default --limit 100)
extole audiences list --filter sfdc                         # match name substring
extole audiences list --limit 500                           # raise cap on big accounts
extole audiences get <name|id>                              # name, size, recent history summary
extole audiences members <name|id>                          # person_id + email rows
extole audiences members <name|id> --email-only             # emails only, one per line
extole audiences members <name|id> --limit 500 --offset 0   # paginate

extole audiences history <name|id>                          # recent ADD / REMOVE / REPLACE / ACTION runs
extole audiences history <name|id> --listen                 # tail new runs as they arrive (Ctrl-C to stop)
extole audiences history <name|id> --listen --interval 3    # custom poll interval (default 5s)
```

The `<audience>` argument resolves by exact ID, then exact name, then case-insensitive substring. Multiple matches prompt for a more specific input.

## Components

Extole's configuration is built from **components** -- typed, composable building blocks that define programs, rules, rewards, emails, integrations, and more. Understanding the component model is prerequisite to building or modifying offer programs programmatically.

The type system is nominal and open-ended -- types form a hierarchy (`reward-supplier-v10.0` is a subtype of `reward-supplier`), and components wire together via named sockets. The reliable way to learn what a type requires is to find a known-good instance and read its config; `extole chat` can also answer type-specific questions.

```
extole components                                  # all components, account-wide
extole components --program <id>                   # scoped to one program
extole components --filter-type reward-supplier    # filter by type (matches subtypes too)
extole components --filter "gift card"             # filter by name substring

extole components get <component-id>               # full config + variables
extole components get <component-id> --tree        # downstream subtree (recursive)
extole components get <component-id> --sockets     # socket references to other components

extole components types                            # all concrete types in this account
extole components types --parent rule              # subtypes of a given parent type
extole components types --parent rule --tree       # rendered as a hierarchy
```

`--filter-type` does substring matching against the full type hierarchy (`--filter-type reward` matches `reward-v10.0`, `reward-rule-v10.0`, etc.). `--tree` on `get` shows the full downstream subgraph.

### Creating Integration Components

`components create` attaches a component to a campaign. Primary use case: webhook integrations where the component discovers its webhook(s) by tag at publish time.

```
# Minimal -- component with no webhook wiring
extole components create --name my_integration --campaign <id>

# With webhook discovery -- component finds the webhook by tag when campaign is published
extole components create \
  --name iterable_integration \
  --display-name "Iterable" \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --description "Sends referral events to Iterable" \
  --webhook-tag "iterable-events"

# Multiple webhooks (auto-named from tag)
extole components create \
  --name my_integration \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --webhook-tag "my-integration-events" \
  --webhook-tag "my-integration-subscriptions"

# Explicit variable name (varName:tag)
extole components create \
  --name my_integration \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --webhook-tag "eventsWebhookId:my-integration-events"

# Print payload without creating (useful for verifying buildtime expressions)
extole components create --name my_integration --campaign <id> --webhook-tag my-events --dry-run
```

Each `--webhook-tag` generates a `javascript@buildtime` variable that resolves the webhook ID at publish time; the resolved ID is stored (no runtime tag lookup).

### Deploying Integration Bundles

`components deploy` bundles a local directory and uploads it. Use for full integration components (`integration-v10.0`, `extension`, etc.) where component, sub-components, webhooks, and scripts live together as a directory tree.

```
# Deploy a new bundle (creates its own campaign)
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration

# Deploy and publish immediately
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration --publish

# Update an existing component in place
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration --component <component-id>

# Update and publish
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration --component <component-id> --publish

# Print resolved component.json contents (post-%{...}% include expansion) without uploading
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration --dry-run

# Show full API error details on failure
extole components deploy --source ./my_integration --verbose
```

Running `deploy` without `--component` always creates a new campaign. Pass `--component` with the ID from the first deploy to update in place. Settings values can reference external files using `%{/path/to/file.js}%` -- the CLI inlines the file content before uploading.

### Patching Component Settings

Update one or more settings on an already-deployed component without redeploying the bundle:

```
extole components set <component-id> --setting apiKey=test_key_123
extole components set <component-id> --setting apiKey=k1 --setting endpoint=https://example.com
extole components set <component-id> --setting apiKey=k1 --dry-run    # show payload only
```

Values are sent as strings; the platform validates and rejects mismatches. Changes on LIVE campaigns are staged until you republish (via `components deploy --publish` or my.extole).

### Deleting Components

```
extole components delete <component-id>             # prompts for confirmation
extole components delete <component-id> --confirm   # skip prompt (for scripts)
extole components delete <component-id> --dry-run   # show what would be deleted
```

Deleting a root component archives its entire campaign; the CLI warns if it's a root before prompting. For a full walkthrough of the bundle format and deployment workflow, contact your Extole solutions engineer.

### Downloading a Campaign Bundle

Download the live campaign bundle from the platform and unpack it locally -- useful for inspecting what's deployed or diffing against a local source tree.

```
extole components download <campaign-id>                      # unpack to ./campaign-name/
extole components download <campaign-id> --output ./my-local  # specify output directory
```

The download reconstructs a readable directory structure: `campaign.json` at the root, assets with the extra platform directory level removed, and creative ZIPs renamed from numeric IDs to their logical names (derived from the step/trigger names in `campaign.json`). The output is not directly deployable via `components deploy` -- `component.json` is not reconstructed -- but it is suitable for inspection and diffing.

## Zones

```
extole zones                                           # list embed zone names for this account
extole zones --json

extole zones core                                      # print the core.js <script> tag for this account
extole zones tag <zone_name>                           # print the embed snippet for a zone

extole zones call <zone_name> --email <email>          # POST to a zone (test FRONTEND_CONTROLLER pipelines)
extole zones call <zone_name> --email <email> --param partner_user_id=abc123
extole zones call <zone_name> --email <email> --json
```

`zones call` POSTs to `/v5/zones/<zone_name>` -- useful for testing FRONTEND\_CONTROLLER + DISPLAY pipelines without a browser.

## Events

### Firing Events

```
extole events fire <event_name>                               # fire in sandbox mode (default -- safe)
extole events fire <event_name> --live                        # fire against the live production API
extole events fire <event_name> --sandbox my-sandbox          # fire in a specific named sandbox
extole events fire lead_created --email jane@example.com
extole events fire lead_created --email jane@example.com --live

extole events fire <event_name> --param key=value [--param key=value ...] --live
extole events fire <event_name> --data '{"email":"jane@example.com","amount":"500"}'
extole events fire <event_name> --dry-run                     # print payload without sending

extole events report <event_id>                               # look up a past event by ID (uses report pipeline, ~30-90s)
extole events fire <event_name> --live --listen               # fire then tail steps for --email for 15s
extole events fire <event_name> --live --listen --listen-timeout 30

extole events fire <event_name> --email <email> --live --trace                        # trace which campaigns the event reached
extole events fire <event_name> --email <email> --live --trace --trace-webhook <id>  # also check that webhook for dispatches caused by this event
extole events fire <event_name> --email <email> --live --trace --trace-timeout 15    # wait longer for slower processing
```

Sandbox mode is the default. Use `--live` for production, `--dry-run` to preview. `--sandbox` sets the sandbox name (default: `production-test`).

### Trace (`--trace`)

Use `--trace` after firing to see exactly which campaigns the event reached. Steps are filtered by `cause_event_id` matching the fired event, then grouped by campaign. If no campaign matched, `--trace` checks `/v2/campaigns/built` to determine why -- distinguishing between "event isn't wired to any campaign" and "campaigns use the event but targeting filtered this person out." `--trace` automatically discovers webhooks attached to campaigns using this event and probes each for dispatches caused by the fired event. Use `--trace-webhook <id>` to override and check a specific webhook directly.

### Listening to Events

`extole events listen` is the preferred way to tail live events. `extole stream` is the underlying command and accepts the same options.

```
extole events listen                                      # all events (noisy on prod -- add filters)
extole events listen --event-type INPUT                   # filter by event type (repeatable)
extole events listen --event-type INPUT --event-type REWARD
extole events listen --filter lead_created                # filter by event name (repeatable)
extole events listen --email jane@example.com             # filter to one person
extole events listen --app-type my_integration            # filter by source (repeatable)
extole events listen --sandbox container-test             # filter by sandbox/container
extole events listen --duration 30                        # auto-exit after 30 seconds
extole events listen --tail 10                            # exit after 10 events (non-interactive tools)
extole events listen --json                               # newline-delimited JSON
```

Creates an ephemeral `/v6/event-streams` session, polls every 2.5s, and cleans up on Ctrl+C or when `--duration`/`--tail` is reached.

**Recommended starting filters for production clients** (unfiltered streams are very noisy):

```
extole events listen --event-type INPUT                      # business events fired by integrations
extole events listen --event-type INPUT --event-type REWARD  # business events + reward issuance
extole events listen --app-type my_integration               # only events from a specific integration
```

**Event type reference:**

| Type                       | What it is                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INPUT`                    | Business events fired by integrations (lead\_created, opportunity\_closedwon, etc.) |
| `REWARD`                   | Reward state transitions (issued, fulfilled, redeemed)                              |
| `STEP`                     | Processing steps triggered by input events                                          |

## Webhooks

Outbound webhooks send Extole events to external systems via HTTP POST. Four types:

| Type      | When it fires                                                                                       | Unique field                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GENERIC` | Person/consumer journey events (referral, share, purchase, custom input events)                     | --                                                  |
| `CLIENT`  | Admin/operational events -- config change, report complete, campaign started, webhook failure, etc. | --                                                  |
| `REWARD`  | Reward state transitions (EARNED, FULFILLED, FAILED, etc.)                                          | `filters`                                           |
| `PARTNER` | Manual dispatch only -- no automatic trigger                                                        | `response_body_handler` (parses HTTP response body) |

```
extole webhooks                                    # list all webhooks with URL
extole webhooks --filter-type GENERIC              # filter by type
extole webhooks --filter "sfdc"                    # filter by name substring
extole webhooks --json

extole webhooks get <webhook-id>                   # full config: URL, method, tags, retry intervals
extole webhooks get <webhook-id> --built           # show with inherited defaults applied
                                                   # (REWARD webhooks also show state/supplier filters)

extole webhooks create --name "SFDC Events" --url https://example.com/hook
extole webhooks create --name "SFDC Events" --url https://example.com/hook --type GENERIC
extole webhooks create --name "Iterable Events" --url https://api.iterable.com/api/events/track \
  --type CLIENT --tag iterable-events --request-file request.js
extole webhooks create --name "Reward Hook" --url https://example.com/hook \
  --type REWARD --filter-state EARNED --filter-state FULFILLED
extole webhooks create --name "Test" --url https://example.com/hook --dry-run  # print payload, no POST

extole webhooks delete <webhook-id>                # archive (fails if still wired to a campaign)
```

### Webhook Types and the `--tag` Flag

Tags enable the **component-driven integration pattern** -- components discover which webhook to call by tag at publish time rather than hardcoding an ID.

```
# Create a webhook with a discovery tag
extole webhooks create \
  --name "Iterable Events" \
  --url https://api.iterable.com/api/events/track \
  --type GENERIC \
  --tag "iterable-events"

# Create a component on the same campaign that discovers it by tag
extole components create \
  --name "iterable_integration" \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --webhook-tag "iterable-events"
```

When the campaign is published, the component resolves the webhook ID from the tag and stores it -- no separate campaign controller needed.

### Attaching Webhooks to Campaigns (Controller Model)

`attach` wires a webhook directly to a campaign via a controller -- for simpler cases where no component is needed.

```
extole webhooks attach \
  --webhook <webhook-id> \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --event signed_up

extole webhooks attach \
  --webhook <webhook-id> \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --event purchase \
  --event-type STEP              # STEP = internal processing step; INPUT = integration event (default)

# Attach multiple events to one campaign -- defer publish until the last one
extole webhooks attach --webhook <id> --campaign <id> --event signed_up --skip-publish
extole webhooks attach --webhook <id> --campaign <id> --event purchase    # publishes once here
```

`--quality` controls dispatch priority: `HIGH` (normal), `LOW` (best-effort), `ALWAYS` (bypasses campaign targeting rules). Defaults to `HIGH`.

### Live Testing

`webhooks trace` temporarily wires a URL to a campaign event and tails dispatch results -- no external tunnel needed:

```
extole webhooks trace \
  --url https://my-server.com/hook \
  --campaign <campaign-id> \
  --event signed_up \
  --yes                          # skip confirmation prompt
```

### Inspecting Dispatch History

```
extole webhooks dispatches <webhook-id>            # what Extole tried to send (attempt records)
extole webhooks dispatches <webhook-id> --limit 50

extole webhooks dispatch-results <webhook-id>      # HTTP outcomes: response codes + bodies
extole webhooks dispatch-results <webhook-id> --json

extole webhooks listen <webhook-id>                # tail dispatch results in real time (Ctrl-C to stop)
extole webhooks listen <webhook-id> --interval 5   # custom poll interval (default 3s)
extole webhooks listen <webhook-id> --show-body    # print full response body per row
extole webhooks listen <webhook-id> --duration 60  # auto-exit after 60 seconds
```

`dispatches` = one record per attempt. `dispatch-results` = HTTP response side (non-200s, timeouts, error bodies). `listen` is the live-tail version -- seeds on first poll so only new attempts appear.

## Notifications

Show recent platform notifications for this account -- webhook failures, integration errors, and other actionable system alerts. Same data as `my.extole.com/notifications`. Useful when debugging "the integration looks wired up but nothing's happening" -- the notifications often name the exact campaign and event the platform couldn't process.

```
extole notifications                   # last 20 most-recent-first
extole notifications --limit 50        # paginate (default 20)
extole notifications --level ERROR     # ERROR / WARN / INFO filter
extole notifications --tag technical   # tag filter (server-side; repeat for multiple)
extole notifications --listen          # tail new ones as they arrive (default 10s poll)
extole notifications --json            # raw response, suitable for scripting
```

Each notification shows time, level, name, message, and key data fields (campaign\_id, controller\_id, person\_id, cause\_event\_id) -- most of which feed into other CLI commands.

## Reports

**Discovery → describe → run** is the self-documenting flow -- each step's output feeds the next:

```
extole reports recommended                       # curated starting picks for this account (default 5)
extole reports types --filter <term>             # find reports by name/description/categories
extole reports describe --type <name>            # required vs optional params, types, defaults, allowed values
extole reports run --type <name> -p key=value    # execute
```

`describe` is the contract for `run` -- surfaces every parameter: required vs optional, type (`TIME_RANGE`, `STRING`, `ENUM`, etc.), defaults, and allowed values.

```
extole reports                                   # list saved report runners
extole reports types                             # list ALL report types (no filter)
extole reports recommended --limit 10            # more than 5 recommendations
extole reports recommended --json                # raw response for scripting

extole reports run --type REPORT_TYPE [options]  # create report, returns ID immediately
  --days <n>           set time_range to last N days (mutually exclusive with -p time_range)
  -p key=value         report parameter (repeatable)
  --format <fmt>       output format: JSON (default), JSONL, CSV -- see `reports describe`
  --wait               poll until complete
  --download           download and print result (implies --wait)

extole reports status REPORT_ID                  # check if a report is done
extole reports download REPORT_ID                # download a completed report
extole reports download REPORT_ID --wait         # wait for completion then download
```

The CLI does not validate parameters client-side -- it packs `-p` values into the request and lets the platform reject invalid ones. `--download` streams to stdout; pipe through `jq .` to pretty-print or `jq -c <filter>` with `--format jsonl`.

Examples:

```
# Discover active programs
extole reports run --type summary_per_program --days 365 \
  -p period=MONTH -p dimensions=PROGRAM --download

# Full program event funnel
extole reports run --type summary --days 365 \
  -p period=MONTH -p dimensions=PROGRAM \
  -p "flows=/business-events" -p container=all --download

# Pipe to jq
extole reports run --type summary_per_program --days 365 \
  -p period=MONTH -p dimensions=PROGRAM --download \
  | jq '[.[].program] | unique'

# Stream large summaries as JSONL
extole reports run --type summary --days 30 \
  -p period=DAY -p dimensions=PROGRAM --format jsonl --download \
  | jq -c 'select(.program == "referrals")'
```

## Health

Domain and email deliverability checks. The base command is read-only -- validates email domains (SPF, DMARC, DKIM, MX, A records) and program domains (CNAME/A resolution) against Extole's validation API. Nothing is created or modified by `extole health` itself; the `provision-dkim` subcommand is the only write operation, and it requires explicit confirmation.

```
extole health                       # check all email domains + program domains
extole health --domain example.com  # filter to a specific email domain
extole health --json                # raw validation results

# DKIM provisioning (write operation -- interactive prompt by default)
extole health provision-dkim example.com           # prompts before calling
extole health provision-dkim example.com --confirm # non-interactive (for scripts/CI)
```

`provision-dkim` is idempotent -- first call mints DKIM keys, subsequent calls return existing records. Output is the CNAME records to add to your DNS provider; re-run `extole health --domain <domain>` to verify.

Exit codes: `0` = all checks pass, `1` = one or more failures, `2` = bad input or auth error. Suitable for CI preflight scripts and readiness probes.

## Chat

`extole chat` gives access to an Extole AI agent with deep knowledge of the API, component model, event semantics, and reward flows. Use it **before** exploring blindly.

Good uses:

- **API discovery**: "what endpoint do I use to filter steps by a specific event?"
- **Concept clarification**: "what's the difference between a journey and a step?"
- **Debugging guidance**: "why would a purchase event not trigger a reward?"
- **Design validation**: "if I want to enroll a person into a program, what's the right API approach?"
- **Schema lookup**: "what fields does the reward-supplier component type require?"

```
extole chat "what endpoint filters person steps by cause event id?"
extole chat "why aren't events firing for jane@example.com"
extole chat "explain the reward supplier types available"
extole chat "what's the difference between causeEventIds and rootEventIds on steps?"
```

Uses your stored Extole token; no separate login. `chat` and `feedback` are excluded from `extole serve` to avoid circular tool calls.

## Feedback

```
extole feedback the --filter-state flag should mention it is REWARD-only in the help text
extole feedback auth login flow was confusing at first, needed to read the README
```

Creates a Jira ticket via the Extole AI agent. Includes your account name and CLI version automatically.

## API

### Search

Search across all published Extole API endpoints by keyword -- useful when you know what you want to do but aren't sure which path or method to use:

```
extole api search batch                        # find all batch job endpoints
extole api search person --spec integration    # search integration spec only
extole api search erasure --detail             # show full description + request fields
extole api search reward --spec integration    # reward state-transition endpoints
```

Searches path, summary, description, and tags across the management and integration-server specs. Results update automatically as Extole publishes spec changes -- no CLI update required.

### Escape Hatch

Direct authenticated access to any endpoint -- for cases where no specific subcommand exists yet:

```
extole api /v2/campaigns/123/controllers
extole api /v6/webhooks/built
extole api /v2/campaigns/123/publish --method POST --body '{}'
extole api /v4/tokens --auth-base  # use api.extole.com instead of api.extole.io
```

GET by default. `--method` to override, `--body` for POST/PUT/PATCH, `--auth-base` for the auth API. Output is JSON-formatted and supports `--compact`.

## Output Conventions

- Human-readable by default; `--json` on all commands
- `--compact` strips nulls and empty fields (useful for piping to agents)
- `--verbose` logs each HTTP request (`→ METHOD URL`) to stderr
- Exit 0 = success, 1 = API error, 2 = bad input/config, 130 = Ctrl+C, 143 = SIGTERM
- Data goes to stdout, status/progress goes to stderr (pipeable)

## Config File

`~/.extole/config`:

```json
{
  "_default": "acme",
  "acme": { "token": "..." },
  "acme-sandbox": { "token": "..." }
}
```
