## Overview

**Analytics** — Pull report data from the Extole API on a configurable schedule (hourly, daily, or weekly) and display it as metric tiles inside Salesforce. Admins choose which Extole reports to surface and how frequently to sync.

**Send Events** — Lets admins define record-triggered events that fire to Extole when Salesforce records change. For example: send an event to Extole when a Lead is created, or when an Opportunity moves to Closed Won. No code required — the app generates and deploys the necessary Salesforce Flow automatically.

**Receive Events** - Provides a real-time webhook endpoint that captures customer referral and advocacy data directly from Extole. By using customizable writeback rules, you can automatically map these incoming events to instantly create or update Lead and Contact records within Salesforce.

**Audience Configurator&#x20;**— Allows admins to define and create Extole audiences using Salesforce reports. For example, you can build a report of contacts on customer accounts and sync them directly to Extole. As new contacts are added to the Salesforce report, they are automatically added to the Extole audience. These audiences can then be used in Extole to manage program eligibility or trigger email invites.

**Share Link Backfill** — Bulk-enrolls existing Contacts and Leads into Extole and writes their share links back to Salesforce. Audiences can be a Closed/Won opportunity filter, a date range, or a custom Salesforce report.

**List View** — A configurable list of Contacts or Leads filtered by a chosen field/value (e.g. by share-link source) for at-a-glance attribution review.

**Apex Classes** — Backend logic for syncing, event handling, and Tooling API integration.

**Custom Metadata Type** (`Extole_Event_Config__mdt`) — Stores built-in event templates: Lead Created, Lead Converted, Opportunity Closed Won.

## Auth model

The app uses two Named Credentials for all external callouts — no tokens are stored in Apex code or custom fields.

**Extole API** (`Extole_API`) — Custom External Credential using a long-lived bearer token generated from the Extole Security Center. Used by the sync job and event handlers to call `https://my.extole.com/security-center`.

**Salesforce Tooling API** (`Extole_Tooling`) — OAuth External Credential backed by a Connected App. Used by the Event Configurator to deploy generated Flows into the org. Requires a one-time admin OAuth authorization after setup.

***

## Ongoing maintenance

- **Sync cadence** — Change in Configure KPIs → Sync Management. The scheduled job is automatically re-registered on save.
- **Adding KPIs** — Configure KPIs → Add Report. New tiles appear on the Analytics after the next sync.
- **Event configs** — Configure Events. Create, edit, deactivate, or delete event triggers. Before deleting, the app calls the Extole API to check whether the event is still referenced by an active campaign. Deleting a config also removes the associated Flow automatically.
- **Failure notifications** — Configure KPIs → Sync Management. Enable email alerts after N consecutive sync failures.
- **Debug logging** — Configure Events → Debug. Enable for detailed per-sync logs. Disable when not actively troubleshooting to avoid log volume.
- **Backfilling share links** — Manage Share Links. Pick an audience (Closed/Won opps, date range, or custom report), choose the target field, and run. Progress and results are recorded in the backfill log.
- **List View setup** — Manage List View. Choose the object, filter field/value, columns, and start date for the List View tab.
- **Log retention** — Sync logs, event logs, and debug logs are automatically purged after 30 days on each sync run.
